            <h2>Beginning</h2>
            <p>November 25th, 2021 at 10:43, and a little boba 
                decided to send a "hi" to a tomato. From there a conversation
                started. Boba and Tomato didn't know what would happenen between 
                them but, Boba started to have feelings for tomato. Eventually on concert 
                day for band, boba on snapchat posts that she likes tomato and well 
                tomota sees it but doesn't really say anything. It wasn't untl December 27th, 2021
                when tomato finally decides to confess to boba that he also has feelings for her, and to 
                the crowds surprise they remained "friends" even if that meant that they would 
                soon plan a kiss and hug each other in school.

            <h2>Offical Day</h2>
            <p>Feburary 27th, 2022 - Boba and tomato have been talking for a while
                and both loved each other, but there was something missing and it was that 
                they weren't in a relationship yet. It was obvious that both had feelings and loved each other, 
                boba and tomato would say "I love you" and "Te quiero" before going to sleep. So, tomato decided to ask the question, 
                yes it might've been in an un-romantic may but it was through snapchat. But Boba said yes 
                and from that day on boba has been tomato's girlfriend.

              <h2>Last Day</h2>
              <p>Feburary 28th, 2022 - It is never easy to say bye to people, especially 
                the one you love the most. In the case of tomato boba was moving to another 
                state and unfortunately for tomato, the day came when boba had to leave. Tomato really
                didn't want boba to leave because she was everything to him, the only person who 
                understood him and stayed with him. Not having boba is person would take the joy away from school. 
                But nothing could be done. As boba and tomato were finally walking to the exit, tomato just remembered 
                the happy moments both share, at the same time tomato tried to enjoy the last minutes with boba. Then the time finally
                came, boba had to leave. Boba and tomato hugged each other, tomato really tried his hardest to not cry 
                but after boba left he did cry. Tomato was just sad that he finally found the person that made him happy, but now 
                that person was going to be far away.

              <h2>August 4th</h2>
              <p>This is a day that Tomato really enjoyed and will never forget. Boba and toamto were still
                far away, however, tomato decided he could visit boba by going to Wisconsin by train so he did. However, he 
                did not tell his parents. It was his second time in Wisonsin but it wasn't bad at all because tomato saw
                the boba he really loved. The day started well, tomato went to boba's house and watched cartons for little kids while
                boba got ready. The first place they went to was the park, a park they went to the first time tomato went to visit boba. 
                At the park they just talked and walked around, holding arms and running down the hill like thing. A lady talked to them about religon something
                but boba eventually destroyed the card the lady gave us. Both then walked about an hour to go get ice cream and tomato found out 
                that boba hadn't eaten so that was her breakfeast :) from there they went to another park. At this park, tomato really enjoyed the time with boba. 
                Both took pictures there which tomato looks at whenever he wants remember a good memory. They kissed a little and leaned on each other which 
                tomato really liked. He'll never forget the feeling of a girl leaning on him. Tomato wanted to eat so they went to this place near boba's house which was also far but they walked it
                and at this place boba was shy to order :) so eating there was a bee that wouldn't leave boba and tomato but eventually it did. Like little kids boba and tomato played tag which was fun but 
                time was running out it was all most time to leave but boba and tomato still went to another park. But then Boba gets a call that her stepdad got home and wants her home already, eventually 
                tomato has to get the train but gets there too late and the train leaves, so then, tomato gets on the next train but goes with boba's family in the meantime and helps them at 
                lowes because boba was too shy to talk :) honestly a day to never forget.

              <h2>Present Day</h2>
              <p>The future is unknown, anything can happen, we could break up, we could get married, we could
                could win the lottery, anyting could happen. So this section is just really to say that Tomato has been his happiest 
                being with boba. Tomato doesn't think Boba realizes how much he actually cares and loves Boba, becuase it is a lot, as Tomato would say
                , "Un poco mucho" (Tomato).
