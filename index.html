            <h2>Beginning</h2>
            <p>November 25th, 2021 at 10:43, and a little boba 
                decided to send a "hi" to a tomato. From there a conversation
                started. Boba and Tomato didn't know what would happenen between 
                them but, Boba started to have feelings for tomato. Eventually on concert 
                day for band, boba on snapchat posts that she likes tomato and well 
                tomota sees it but doesn't really say anything. It wasn't untl December 27th, 2021
                when tomato finally decides to confess to boba that he also has feelings for her, and to 
                the crowds surprise they remained "friends" even if that meant that they would 
                soon plan a kiss and hug each other in school. So, tomato decided to ask the question, 
                yes it might've been in an un-romantic may but it was through snapchat. But Boba said yes 
                and from that day on boba has been tomato's girlfriend.

            <h2>Offical Day</h2>
            <p>Feburary 27th, 2022 - Boba and tomato have been talking for a while
                and both loved each other, but there was something missing and it was that 
                they weren't in a relationship yet. It was obvious that both had feelings and loved each other, 
                boba and tomato would say "I love you" and "Te quiero" before going to sleep.
